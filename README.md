This component develops techniques to classify the profile of nodes in a Cloud-IoT infrastructure and correspondingly generate requirements to reduce the energy consumed by MSAs deployed on such infrastructure. In addition, the relationship between an MSA components, based on the connections/functional dependencies between microservices and the information on the data they exchange, are considered in the analysis to provide information about microservice coplacement to the solver.
