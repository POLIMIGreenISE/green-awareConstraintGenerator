A avoidNode constraint was generated for the deployment of the frontend component in the large flavour on the greatbritain node. This decision was driven by the high resource consumption of the selected flavour combined with the poor energy mix of the target node.
The estimated emissions savings resulting from avoiding this deployment range between 563.6686139999999 gCO2eq and 231.762222 gCO2eq.
A avoidNode constraint was generated for the deployment of the frontend component in the large flavour on the italy node. This decision was driven by the high resource consumption of the selected flavour combined with the poor energy mix of the target node.
The estimated emissions savings resulting from avoiding this deployment range between 912.7425780000001 gCO2eq and 349.07396400000005 gCO2eq.
